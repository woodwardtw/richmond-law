U	Morson, for the appellants., There was no counsel for the appellees.		<p>Executors and Administrators — Sale of Realty — Failure to'Pay Over Proceeds — Liability of Sureties.* — Testator by his will gives certain property to his wife during her life; and directs that at her death, his executors should sell it and divide the proceeds among his children. The executor does after the death of the widow, take possession of the property and sell it, but does not pay over the proceeds. .Held: His official sureties are responsible for his failure to pay it over.</p>	<p>This was a suit instituted in thé Circuit court of Rappahannock county by Mrs. Almond before her marriage with her present husband, against Daniel Mason, as administrator de bonis non with the will annexed of William Porter deceased, arid as administrator of Sarah Porter, .the father and mother of the plaintiff, for an account and distribution of both estates. The sureties of Mason in both characters, and the legatees and distributees of both were made parties, and it was alleged that Mason was insolvent, of which there does not seem to have been any question.</p> <p>William Porter died in 1815; and by his will, among other provisions, gave a part of his property, real and personal, to his wife during her life or widowhood. And he directed, that if she should not marry during her natural life, at her death his executors should proceed to sell the whole of his estate and divide the money as above directed. The previous directions as to his other estate was that it should be equalty divided among bis children.</p> <p>Of the executors appointed in the will one died, and the powers of the other were revoked in 1836, when *the unadministered estate was committed to Daniel Mason as administrator de bonis non with the will annexed. The bond he executed did not embrace land.</p> <p>It appeared from the commissioner’s report that the only assets which came to the hands of Mason as representative of William Porter deceased, was the personal property which had gone into the possession of the widow under her husband’s will, and which, never having married again, she retained until her death in 1836.</p> <p>The commissioner’s report ascertained that there was due to the plaintiff from Mason as administrator, &c., of William Porter the sum of 694 dollars 33 cents, and as administrator of Sarah Porter the sum of 106 dollars 89 cents, both sums as of the date of the 31st of December 1839; and at the same date the plaintiff was debtor to Mason on private account a sum which, deducted from the amount due from him as administrator, left him debtor as of that date 246 dollars 49 cents.</p> <p>The plaintiff having intermarried with William R. Almond, the suit was carried on in their joint names; and Mason having died, it was revived against his administrator; and came on to be finally heard in September 184S, when the court dismissed the bill as to the sureties of Mason as administrator, &c., with the will annexed of William Porter, with costs, being of opinion that they were not liable for any waste of the assets which had gone into the possession of Mrs. Porter for her life under the will of her husband, after the same had been taken into the possession of the administrator, upon her death. And the court decreed that the administrator of Mason should, out of the assets of his intestate in his hands to be administered, pay to the plaintiffs the said sum of 246 dollars 49 cents, with interest thereon at the rate of six per cent, per annum from the 31st of December 1839 until paid, and their *costs. Prom this decree the plaintiffs applied to this court for an appeal, which was allowed.</p>	0	Published	FALSE	law.free.cap.gratt.9/700.4450554.json		65735869		8481472	Allen	FALSE		020lead									<opinion type="majority"> <author id="b353-14">ALLEN, J.,</author> <p id="AP3">delivered the opinion of the court.</p> <p id="b353-15">It appearing that the father of the female appellant by his last will and testament, duly executed and admitted to probat, did, amongst other things, bequeath certain personal property therein described to his wife during her natural life or widowhood; that two of the executors named in the will took upon themselves the execution of said office; that one of said executors departed this life, and the surviving executor was removed from his office, and administration de bonis non with the will annexed was committed to Daniel Mason, who executed bond with the security and qualified as such administrator according to law; and it furthermore appearing by the report of the master commissioner, made out in pursuance of the interlocutory decree, that the w'hole of the personal estate of William Porter, the said testator, which came to the hands of said administrator de bonis non with the will annexed, was property held and enjoyed during her life by Sarah Porter, the widow of said William Porter, in virtue of the bequest aforesaid; and it also appearing that the testator by his will after the bequest to his wife as aforesaid, furthermore declared that in case she should not marry during her natural life, it was his will and desire that at her decease his executors should proceed to sell the whole of his estate, and divide the money arising therefrom as in the will directed ; this court is of opinion that the assent of the executors to the legacy to the widow during her natural life or widowhood, and her enjoyment thereof under said bequest during her natural life, was not a full administration *of the personal estate in this case. The will made no disposition of the specific properly in favor of any third person after the death or marriage of the widow, but on the contrary required the executors at her decease to sell the property, describing it as part of his estate; thus making it the duty of the personal representative, in execution of the will, to take and sell the said personal estate when the life estate terminated, as part of the assets of the estate. The court is therefore of opinion that when after the death of the widow the administrator de bonis non with the will annexed took possession of and sold the personal property bequeathed to her during her natural life or widowhood, he was acting in virtue of his office and in performance of the duty imposed upon him by his office and the will of the testator; and that the sureties in his official bond were liable for his faithful administration thereof: It being the duty of the administrator to pay over the proceeds arising from the sale of such properly amongst the residuary legatees in the mode prescribed in the will; and by the condition of their bond, they bound themselves that he should pay and deliver all the legacies contained and specified in the will as far as the goods, chattels and credits would extend. The court is therefore of opinion that the said decree is erroneous. It is therefore adjudged and ordered that the same be reversed with costs. And this cause is remanded to be further pro-ceded in according to the principles above declared in order to a final decree.</p> </opinion>		TRUE	8509098	{"9 Gratt. 700"}																													1853	https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/8509098/almond-v-masons-admr/

Powers of Attorney—Strictly Construed—Sale of Land under a Power to Recover—Requisite of Power to make a Deed.—A power of attorney which simply authorizes the attorney to demand and receive all real and personal property of the principal does not confer authority to sell and convey his real estate. Powers of attorney are construed strictly, and, though the intention of the parties is to be considered in construing the language used, the authority of the attorney is never considered to be greater than that warranted by the language of the instrument, or indispensable to the effective operation of such authority. Authority to .execute a deed must be by deed.</p> <p>2. Chancery Jurisdiction—Sale of Lands out of State—Power to Compel Conveyance of Lands out of State.—Real estate is exclusively subject to the laws and jurisdiction of the courts of the State in which it is located. Courts of equity in one State cannot decree the sale of lands of a person under disability lying in another State. In cases of fraud, trust, or contract, however, courts of equity having jurisdiction over the parties, may administer full Telief, without regard to the nature or situation of the property, and may even compel the conveyance of property which lies beyond its jurisdiction, provided it can enforce its decree by the exercise of its powers over the persons before it. ■ It is no violation of the sovereignty of one State for a court of equity of another State to compel a party before it to do an act which, if done voluntarily anywhere, would not be such violation. <</p> <p>3. Ratification— Confirmation—Waiver.—Ratification and acquiescence imply knowledge, and no man will be held to have waived rights of which he was ignorant, nor to have ratified a deed when ignorant of its existence, and of the circumstances attending its execution.</p> <p>4. Deeds—Tax-Title.—A deed from a clerk of the County Court conveying to a purchaser land sold for taxes conveys only such title as was vested in the party assessed with the taxes on account whereof the sale was made.</p>		<p>Appeal from a decree of the Circuit Court of Rockingham county pronounced Hovember 2, 1895, in a suit in chancery wherein the appellee, Samuel Middlekauf, and others were the complainants, and the appellant and others were the defendants.</p>	0	Published	FALSE	law.free.cap.va.96/649.2340428.json	harvard_pdf/6914626.pdf	63902901		6810025	Keith	FALSE		020lead									<opinion type="majority"> <author id="b674-11">Keith, P.,</author> <p id="AId">delivered the opinion of the court.</p> <p id="b674-12">Hotchkiss, trustee, brought an action of ejectment in the Circuit Court of Rockingham county against Samuel Middlekauf and others to recover 5,000 acres of land lying in said county. Before this cause was tried, the defendants filed a bill in chancery in which they allege that the 5,000 acres, which is the subject-matter of the ejectment suit, was part of a larger tract of land originally granted by the Commonwealth on the 8th of February, 1796, to one G-ambill, and that by virtue of certain deeds they have become the owners of the land in controversy, and have thus become “ joint owners ” with the plaintiff in ejectment in the proportion' which the 5,000 acres bears to the whole of the original patent, the title to the residue of which they concedé is in Hotchkiss, trustee. In accordance with the prayer of the bill, proceedings in the action of ejectment were enjoined, and the chancery cause coming on to be heard upon the bill, answer, exhibits, depositions, and the report of the commissioner in chancery, to <page-number citation-index="1" label="651">*651</page-number>whom it had been referred, the court decreed “ that the complainants * * * be quieted in their possession and ownership of the 5,000 acres of land known as the Hill survey, upon the terms indicated in the report of Commissioner Liggett.” The cause is before us upon an appeal from that decree.</p> <p id="b675-7">Appellant urged upon the court that there was error in the decree for the reason, among others, that the bill was to be taken as claiming a tenancy in common upon the part of the plaintiffs with the defendants, while the decree was in favor of the plaintiffs for an ascertained tract of 5,000 acres. But, without entering upon any discussion of that and other technical objections taken to the proceedings in the Circuit Court, we shall content ourselves with an enquiry into the title presented for our consideration by the appellees, and endeavor to ascertain whether they have shown any right whatever to the real estate in controversy.</p> <p id="b675-8">Their alleged title, like that of the appellant, begins with the grant from the Commonwealth of Virginia to Matthew Gambill, dated February 8, 1796, and the chains of title of appellant and appellees are coincident until the deed from States Wilkins and Geo. F. Butler, attorney in fact, and committee of Helen Hawkesworth, to James R. Mount, is reached.</p> <p id="b675-9">Appellees claim under a deed to James R. Mount from Geo. F. Butler, claiming to act as the attorney in fact of States Wilkins, and as committee of Helen D. Hawkesworth, a lunatic. Placing the title by this means in James R. Mount, they deduce it through him to Prosper Knowlton; and as to the land of Prosper Knowlton, appellees claim that it was sold for taxes and conveyed by Littleton W. Gambill, clerk of the County Court of Rockingham, to one John H. Hill, of said county, by deed dated the 5th of December, 1857. By Hill it was conveyed to J. D. Price, by deed of the 7th of April, 1866, and from him, by several deeds shown in the record and not disputed, it is vested in the appellees. The deed to Mount was, as we have seen, executed by George F. Butler, as attorney in fact for States Wilkins and committee of a lunatic, and his <page-number citation-index="1" label="652">*652</page-number>power and authority-, both as attorney in fact and as committee, are denied by the appellant. '</p> <p id="b676-6">The authority to execute a deed must be by deed, “for the law requires that the power of attorney to execute a deed should be in writing, and of the same solemnity as the deed itself; * ' * * * * and the authority of the agent should be coextensive with the act to be done, and the instrument clothing him with the authority as complete as the deed which he is to give.” 1 Devlin on Deeds (2 Ed..), sec. 856.</p> <p id="b676-8">The following power of attorney is exhibited with the record: “ Enow all men by these presents,</p> <p id="b676-9">“That I, States Wilkins, of the city of New York, have made, constituted, and appointed, and by these presents do make, constitute, and appoint my friend, George F. Butler, of said city, my irrevocable, true and lawful attorney for me, and in my name, place and stead, to ask, demand and receive of, and from any person or persons, all such real and personal estate as I may be entitled to, by-virtue of my being a son and heir at law of Jacob Wilkins and Ann his wife, late of the city of New York, deceased; and I do hereby irrevocably authorize and empower the said George F. Butler to commence and prosecute in my name any suit or suits in that behalf, and to compromise or settle or compound the same or either of them, from time to time, as he may deem proper, with full power of substitution, irrevocably giving and granting unto my said attorney, full power and authority to do and perform all and every act and thing whatsoever requisite and necessary to be done, in and about the premises, as fully to all intents and purposes, as I might or could do if personally present, with full power of substitution and revocation, hereby ratifying and confirming all that my said attorney or his substitute shall lawfully do or cause to b'e done by virtue hereof.</p> <p id="b676-10">“ In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and seal the 29th day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and thirty-four. '</p> <p id="b676-11">“ STATES WILEIHS.” [L. S.] '</p> <p id="b677-5"><page-number citation-index="1" label="653">*653</page-number>Powers of attorney are strictly construed. “ While the general rule governing the interpretation of all contracts or written instruments, that the intention of the parties is to be considered in construing their language, applies to the construction of powers of attorney, yet powers of attorney are construed strictly, and the authority is never considered to be greater than that warranted by the language of the instrument, or indispensable to the effective operation of such authority. Powers of attorney are, ordinarily, subject to a strict construction; or rather the authority given is not extended beyond the meaning of the terms in which it is expressed.” 1 Devlin on Deeds (2 Ed.), sec. 358.</p> <p id="b677-6">The power of attorney .under consideration nowhere authorizes the agent to sell and convey. He is empowered “ to demand and receive of and from any person or persons all such real and personal estate ” as States Wilkins may be entitled to as son and heir at law of Jacob Wilkins and Ann his wife.</p> <p id="b677-7">Just such an instrument came under consideration before the Court of Civil Appeals of Texas. Said the court: It was <em>“ </em>found as a conclusion of law that the power of attorney from Parsons and wife to Duncan, Morgan, and Adams did not authorize them to sell the land in controversy. The court did not err in this conclusion. The power conferred was <em>‘ </em>to bring suit for, settle up, compromise, release, obtain, or recover the interest belonging to and owned by Louisa C. Parsons,’ etc. The power is not given to sell and convey. Powers of attorney are strictly construed, and the extent of authority must be ascertained from the terms of the instrument itself.”</p> <p id="b677-8">So far, therefore, as George E. Butler undertook to convey as attorney in fact of States Wilkins, his deed is a nullity, because the authority under which he assumed to act conferred no power to execute such an instrument. George E. Butler and States Wilkins were appointed a committee of Helen D. Hawkesworth, a lunatic, by order of the Chancery Court of <page-number citation-index="1" label="654">*654</page-number>the State of New York on the 23d of May, 1836, and on the 8th of August of the same year, upon the petition of George F. Butler, stating that Helen D. Hawkesworth was interested in two large tracts of land in the counties o'f Rockingham, Albemarle, and Orange, in the State of Virginia, that the lands were entirely unproductive, that there was no prospect of their improving in value, that it was to the interest of the lunatic that her interest should be sold, and praying for authority to sell the same, it was referred to one of the masters of the court to ascertain whether it would be advantageous or beneficial to the said lunatic that all her right, title, and interest in the land should be sold. The master was required to report with all convenient speed. He obeyed the order by submitting a report of even date with the order itself, in which he states that the land consists of about 20,000 acres; that it is not worth five cents per acre, and he does not. believe it could be sold for any price in cash; that one half of it belongs to the lunatic; and that, if it is not disposed of, it will probably be sold for taxes. Upon these facts he is of opinion that it would be advantageous and beneficial to Helen D. Hawkesworth, the lunatic, that all her right, title, and interest in said land be sold.</p> <p id="b678-6">The proceedings in the courts of the State of New York by which Helen D. Hawkesworth was adjudged a lunatic, and George F. Butler was appointed her committee and authorized to sell her land in the State of Virginia, and the deed executed by him in conformity with and obedience to that order, constitute the only authority with which Butler was clothed to divest the title of Helen Hawkesworth, and transmit it to his grantee. Hor is it pretended that there is any other deed from her upon which the title of appellees to the land, of which she was seised, can rest. It is settled law that real estate is exclusively subject to the laws and jurisdiction of the courts of the nation or State in which it is located. Ho other laws or courts can affect it. Story’s Conflict of Laws, sec. 591, and it was said <page-number citation-index="1" label="655">*655</page-number>by Chancellor Zabriskie in <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Headley, 7 </em>C. E. Green 115: “I find no case in which a statute, judgment, or proceeding in one country has been held to affect such property when situate in another country, or beyond the jurisdiction of the sovereign or court making the statute or decree.” It is true “ that in cases of fraud, trust, or contract, courts of equity will, whenever jurisdiction over the parties has been acquired, administer full relief without regard to the nature or situation of the property in which the controversy had its origin, and even where the relief sought consists in a decree for the conveyance of property which lies beyond the control of the court, provided it can be reached by the exercise of its powers over the persons and the relief asked is of such a nature as the court is capable of administering.” <em>Wimer </em>v. <em>Wimer, </em>82 Va. 901, and authorities there cited.</p> <p id="b679-6">Between these two propositions there is not the slightest conflict. The decree of the court does not operate <em>ex proprio vigore </em>in the foreign State or Territory, but, having jurisdiction over the person, it will, in cases of fraud, trust, or contract, compel the party within its jurisdiction to obey its decree. As was said by Chancellor Wythe in <em>Farley </em>v. <em>Shippen, </em>Wythe’s Reports, 135, “if an act performed by a party in Virginia, who ought to perform it, will be effectual to convey land in North Carolina, why may not a court of equity in Virginia decree that party, regularly brought before that tribunal, to perform the act? Some of the defendant’s counsel supposed that such a decree would be deemed by our brethren of North Carolina an invasion of their sovereignty. To this shall be allowed the force of a good objection, if those who urge it will prove that the sovereignty of that State will be violated by the Virginia court of equity decreeing a party within its jurisdiction to perform an act there, which act voluntarily performed anywhere, would not be such a violation.” In the last clause above quoted is to be found the very kernel of the matter. A foreign court can compel a party within its juris<page-number citation-index="1" label="656">*656</page-number>diction to do an act in Virginia, which act, if Voluntarily performed by such party, would not violate the sovereignty of this State. If Helen Hawkesworth had been of sound mind, and had voluntarily conveyed the- property in question, it would have been a valid act—valid everywhere. So, if she had, as a result of - contract, trust, or fraud, been under obligation to convey this property, the court of New York, having jurisdiction over her, could have compelled obedience to its decree, and that act which she could voluntarily have performed would have been equally valid though done under the compulsion of a decree of a foreign court. But here we have no such case. Helen Hawkesworth was a lunatic. She has made no deed, and was under no obligation, by contract or otherwise, to make a deed. The authority with which Butler, her committee, was clothed is derived, not from her but from the laws of New York, and the act of her committee derives its whole vitality from the judgment of the court which clothed him with power as her committee, and, upon his petition, decreed the sale of the property of the lunatic lying beyond its jurisdiction and within the limits of this State.</p> <p id="b680-6">We are of opinion that the deed to James R. Mount from George F. Butler, as attorney in fact for States Wilkins and as committee of Helen D. Hawkesworth, was ineffectual to convey the land in controversy. Hor do we think that any efficacy is imparted to it by the subsequent conduct of States Wilkins and of Mrs. Furman, the daughter and heir at law of Helen Hawkesworth, even if the deed of Butler as committee is to be considered as a voidable, and not as a void act. Ratification and acquiescence imply knowledge, and there is no proof in this record that the circumstances relied upon as a ratification of, or acquiescence in, the assumption, upon the part of George F. Butler, of authority to execute the deed to Prosper Knowlton were performed, with knowledge on the part of Wilkins and Mrs. Furman, of the existence of that deed and the circumstances attending its execution.</p> <p id="b680-7">As was said by Judge Harrison in <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>91 Va. <page-number citation-index="1" label="657">*657</page-number>192: £‘ Confirmation must be a solemn and deliberate act. * * * * Ho man can be bound by a waiver of his rights unless such waiver is distinctly made, with full knowledge of the rights which he intends to <em>waive; </em>and the fact that he knows his rights, and intends to waive them, must' plainly appear.”</p> <p id="b681-7">As we have seen, appellee’s title, flowing from the deed of Butler to James R. Mount, passed from him to Prosper Knowlton, and, he being delinquent in the payment of taxes, it was sold by the State, and a deed made by L. W. Gambill, clerk of Rockingham county, on the 5th of December, 1857.</p> <p id="b681-8">What has been said with reference to the deed of George P. Butler, in his double capacity of attorney in fact and committee, renders it unnecessary to say anything with respect to the deed from L. W. Gambill, further than to remark that it conveyed only such title as ,was vested in Prosper Knowlton, who had no title and could therefore transmit none.</p> <p id="b681-9">Nor need we consider whether this tax deed could be, under the circumstances, regarded as constituting color of title, for there is no evidence of adversary possession by force of which color or claim of title could ripen into a good title.</p> <p id="b681-10">Nor do we deem it proper to enquire into the title of appellant, nor to express any opinion with respect thereto.</p> <p id="b681-11">We are of opinion, for the reasons stated, that the decree of the Circuit Court should be reversed, the injunction awarded dissolved, the bill dismissed, and the appellants left to prosecute their action of ejectment in the Circuit Court of Rockingham county without prejudice to the rights of the parties, plaintiff and defendant, to that suit, except in so far as we have found it necessary in this opinion tó pass upon the validity of the deed to James R. Mount from George P. Butler, as attorney in fact for States Wilkins and as committee of Helen D. Hawkesworth.</p> <p id="b681-12"> <em>Reversed.</em> </p> </opinion>		TRUE	6914626	{"96 Va. 649","43 L.R.A. 806","32 S.E. 36","1899 Va.

Sess.), ch. 3, Code, section 1560j, which prescribes the method to be pursued by the board of supervisors in issuing and making sale of the bonds therein <page-number citation-index="1" label="682">*682</page-number>provided for, directs that the said bonds “shall have written or printed in ink the following sentence: ‘These bonds are issued for the construction and operation of a public * * * system in * * * sanitary district, but the full faith and credit of the entire county of * * * is hereby pledged for their payment.’ ”</p> <p id="b742-4">It is contended on behalf of the board of supervisors that the effect of this provision of the statute is to create á debt on the part of the county, upon which question, under the provisions of section 115a of the Constitution, the qualified voters of the entire county are entitled to express their wishes at an election held for the purpose, and, therefore, section 5 of the act, which limits the election upon the question of issuing the bonds to the qualified voters of the sanitary district alone, is in violation of said constitutional provisions.</p> <p id="b742-5">The first part of section 115a of the Constitution provides that no debt shall be contracted by or on behalf of a county or district except in pursuance of authority conferred by the General Assembly by general law. With that provision we now have no concern. The second part of said section which is here invoked, prohibits the General Assembly from authorizing any county or district to contract a debt (with certain exceptions) unless in the general law authorizing the same provision be made for submitting the question of contracting such debt to the qualified voters of the proper county or district, for their approval or disapproval. The contention of appellee, then, resolves itself into the simple question of whether, in view of the above quoted provision of the statute, the issuance of the proposed bonds would constitute the <em>contracting of a debt </em>by the county which comes within the purview of the Constitution, and requires a vote of the electorate of the whole county to approve it.</p> <p id="b742-6">Looking at the act in question we find that authority to construct, maintain and operate water supply, sewerage arid other systems for the benefit of the people of a sanitary district created under the act is vested solely in the <page-number citation-index="1" label="683">*683</page-number>board of supervisors of the county in which the said sanitary district is located. Said board is also given exclusive authority to fix, and provide for the collection of, the rates of charges for the use of any system or systems so constructed. The act further provides that the maximum amount of bonds issued by the board of supervisors for such purposes shall in no case exceed eighteen per centum of the assessed value of all real estate in the sanitary district subject to local taxation; that the net revenue derived from the operation of said system or systems shall be set apart by said board to pay the interest on the bonds issued, and to create a sinking fund to redeem the principal of said bonds at maturity, and that, if necessary for the payment of such interest or to increase the sinking fund, the board of supervisors shall levy an annual 'tax upon all the property in such sanitary district, subject to local taxation, to pay such interest and to make such payments into the sinking fund.</p> <p id="b743-4">Considering the above provisions it is apparent that, although section 10 of the act requires that the credit of the county shall be pledged for the payment of the bonds issued thereunder, it was the purpose of the legislature to make the sanitary district for whose benefit such bonds are issued primarily liable for their payment, and that the county shall be only secondarily liable, as guarantor of said bonds. This being the manifest legislative intent, it necessarily follows that, in order to carry out such intent, and also in accordance with established legal principles, the issuance of such bonds must be considered as a debt contracted by the sanitary district alone, within the meaning and purpose of the Constitution, and not as that of the county, which, under the provisions of the statute, could not be deemed a party to the contracting of such debt.</p> <p id="b743-5">In the case of <em>Goodrich Rubber Co. </em>v. <em>Fisch, </em>141 Va. 261, 127 S. E. 187, 188, Chief Justice Campbell, in defining a guaranty, quotes a distinguished law writer as follows:</p> <p id="b743-6">“A guaranty is an independent contract, by which the <page-number citation-index="1" label="684">*684</page-number>guarantor undertakes, in writing, upon a sufficient undertaking, to be answerable for the debt, or for the performance of some duty, in case of the failure of some other person who is primarily liable to pay or perform.”</p> <p id="b744-4">In 12 R. C. L. p. 1053, the nature of a guaranty is thus defined: “Generally a guaranty relates to the payment of a sum of money or the collectability thereof, though it may constitute an assurance of the genuineness of an obligation or the liability of the obligee. Being a collateral engagement for the performance of the undertaking of another, it imports the existence of two different obligations, one being that of the principal debtor and the other that of the guarantor. If there is no obligation on the part of the principal, there is none on the guarantor. But the debtor is not a party to the guaranty, and the guarantor is not a party to the principal obligation. The guaranty is a separate and independent contract, involving duties and imposing responsibilities very different from those created by the original contract to which it is collateral. The fact that both contracts are written on the same paper or instrument does not affect their separate nature.”</p> <p id="b744-5">In view of these considerations, we think it clear that section 5 of the act, providing that the question of the issuance of bonds for the purposes of a sanitary district shall be submitted to the qualified voters of such district, fully complies with the constitutional provision on the subject, and its validity should, therefore, be sustained.</p> <p id="b744-6">To hold that the Constitution requires the question to be submitted to the qualified voters of the entire county for approval would, in effect, practically nullify the act, and thereby defeat the salutary purpose for which it was designed.</p> <p id="b744-7">There is a presumption that the legislature in the passage of an act intended that it should be effective, and if such an act is susceptible of two constructions, one of which would render the act invalid as being in violation of the Constitution, and the other sustain the validity <page-number citation-index="1" label="685">*685</page-number>of the act, the latter will be adopted upon the presumption that the legislature intended that construction to be given to the act that would make it effective. <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Hoffman, </em>108 Va. 626, 62 S. E. 371; <em>White &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>124 Va. 465, 98 S. E. 24; <em>Eureka Pipe Line Co. </em>v. <em>Hallanan, </em>87 W. Va. 396, 105 S. E. 506.</p> <p id="b745-4">The rule that every presumption is to be made in favor of the constitutionality of a statute, and it can never be declared unconstitutional except when it is plainly and clearly so; and that a reasonable doubt as to its constitutionality must be resolved in favor of the law, is too well established to require the citation of authority. <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>Pace, </em>127 Va. 274, 103 S. E. 647; <em>State Highway Com’r </em>v. <em>Kreger, </em>128 Va. 203, 105 S. E. 217.</p> <p id="b745-5">For the foregoing reasons we are of the opinion that the judgment of the trial court in sustaining the demurrer and dismissing the petition should be reversed, and the proceedings remanded to the court below with directions to award the writ of mandamus as prayed for in the petition.</p> <p id="b745-6"> <em>Reversed and remanded.</em> </p> </opinion>		TRUE	6922611	{"161 Va. 678","172 S.E. 245","1934 Va.

This evidence was crucial to the success of Russillo’s defenses. In my view, that evidence was relevant, properly admitted in support of both defenses, and should not be dodged by the majority in its disposition of the case.</p> <p id="b355-9">A state toxicologist called by Russillo testified that Strike had a blood alcohol content of 0.09 percent at the time of his death. While recognizing that the percentage is below the statutory presumption of intoxication, <em>see </em>Code § 18.2-269, the toxicologist stated “there would be definite decreases of mental... and physical capabilities at .09 percent.” Thus, if Strike, realizing that Russillo was driving recklessly, saw the danger, appreciated it, and failed to give warning, if there was time to do so, he was contributorily negligent. “The fact that [Strike’s] ability to use due care for [his] own safety may have been influenced by the voluntary consumption of alcohol will not excuse [him] from its consequences.” <em>Major </em>v. <em>Hoppe, </em>209 Va. 193, 200, 163 S.E.2d 164, 169 (1968). The testimony of the toxicologist tended to prove the degree of Strike’s ability to assess the danger, if he observed it, and his ability to give timely warning, if there was an opportunity to do so, and was admissible for that purpose.</p> <p id="b355-10">Likewise, regarding assumption of risk, the test result was relevant to show that Strike’s consumption of alcohol affected his decision voluntarily to remain in the car and continue the joyride. <page-number citation-index="1" label="336">*336</page-number>The jury was entitled to consider whether Strike’s euphoria, fuelled by a mixture of brandy and champagne, made him more prone to be adventurous and to ride with Russillo when, if in full control of his ability to assess danger, he probably would have decided to stay out of the vehicle.</p> <p id="b356-4">By ducking the blood-test issue, the majority is able to focus only on “who was driving.” But this is merely one ingredient of the total circumstances surrounding the fatal crash, and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of other relevant facts.</p> <p id="b356-5">Strike was responsible for setting the events in motion on the night of the accident. It was Strike who procured the bottle of brandy from his parents’ “liquor cabinet.” It was Strike who packed a cooler with ice and placed it in the back of the car. It was Strike who retrieved the champagne from its hiding place along the road near his home. And, of course, it was Strike who provided his own automobile for the joyride. Strike drove erratically when he resumed driving after having allowed Russillo to drive for “quite awhile.” Said Russillo: “He put two of the wheels on somebody’s lawn, and that hit me as unusual, because I had never known him to drive like that.”</p> <p id="b356-6">This evidence establishes that Strike initiated a course of conduct for Russillo to follow. That course began with the procurement of alcoholic beverages. It continued when Strike allowed Russillo to drive the vehicle. And, it assumed dangerous and later fatal proportions when the vehicle was put through at least two sequences of skidding and speeding. In sum, Strike became the victim of his own careless and venturesome conduct. Manifestly, jury issues were presented on both assumption of risk and contributory negligence. <em>Monk </em>v. <em>Hess, </em>213 Va. 244, 191 S.E.2d 229 (1972); <em>Budzinski </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>213 Va. 107, 189 S.E.2d 372 (1972).</p> <p id="b356-7">There is another aspect of the majority’s decision that troubles me. The proposition that the defendant was guilty of primary negligence which was a proximate cause of the collision has not been disputed on appeal. Yet, the case is being reversed because of lack of evidence to support the defenses and “for further proceedings.” The only proceedings possible will be on the questions of primary negligence and proximate cause (issues already finally adjudicated) and damages. This is a rather odd result. If I agreed with the majority on the merits of the appeal, I would hold that de<page-number citation-index="1" label="337">*337</page-number>fendant’s liability has been fixed and would remand the case for a trial on the issue of damages only.</p> <p id="b357-4">COCHRAN AND POFF, JJ., join in dissent.</p> </opinion>		FALSE	1269471	{"343 S.E.2d 84","231 Va. 328","1986 Va.

HASSELL, SR. v.   Record No. 010310              March 1, 2002  JACK LEE, WARDEN, KEEN MOUNTAIN CORRECTIONAL CENTER               FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF POWHATAN COUNTY                       Thomas V. Warren, Judge        The sole issue that we consider in this appeal is whether  the circuit court properly dismissed a petition for writ of  habeas corpus because it was not filed timely pursuant to Code  § 8.01-654(A)(2).   This statute, which became effective July  1, 1998, states:             "A petition for writ of habeas corpus ad       subjiciendum, other than a petition challenging a       criminal conviction or sentence, shall be brought       within one year after the cause of action accrues.       A habeas corpus petition attacking a criminal       conviction or sentence, except as provided in       § 8.01-654.1 for cases in which a death sentence has       been imposed, shall be filed within two years from       the date of final judgment in the trial court or       within one year from either final disposition of the       direct appeal in state court or the time for filing       such appeal has expired, whichever is later."        Michael Haas is incarcerated by the Virginia Department  of Corrections and detained at the Keen Mountain Correctional  Center.    He was convicted in 1994 of two counts of sodomy  against his two sons.   His punishment was fixed at two terms  of life imprisonment.      On June 30, 2000, Haas filed his petition for writ of  habeas corpus against Jack Lee, Warden of the Keen Mountain  Correctional Center.   He alleged, among other things, that his  due process rights were violated, that his trial counsel was  ineffective, and that the Commonwealth's Attorney purportedly  committed acts of misconduct.       The Warden filed a motion to dismiss and asserted that  because Haas was convicted before the enactment of Code  § 8.01-654(A)(2) and more than two years had passed from the  date of the final judgment in the circuit court, he was  required to file his habeas corpus petition, pursuant to  orders entered by this Court, within one year from the  effective date of Code § 8.01-654(A)(2).   The Warden contended  that Haas' petition must be dismissed because he was required  to file it on or before June 30, 1999, but he did not do so.  The circuit court agreed with the Warden and entered a final  order dismissing the petition.   Haas appeals.       Before the enactment of Code § 8.01-654(A)(2), a prisoner  could file a habeas corpus petition at any time provided that  the Commonwealth was not prejudiced in its ability to respond  because of the prisoner's delay in filing.   See Walker v.  Mitchell, Warden, 224 Va. 568, 575-77, 299 S.E.2d 698, 702-03  (1983).   After the enactment of this statute, a prisoner who  had not been sentenced to death was required to file his                                    2 petition within two years from the date of final judgment in  the circuit court or one year from either final disposition of  the direct appeal in the state court or the time for filing  such appeal has expired, whichever is later.   The statute is  silent, however, regarding the filing period for prisoners who  were convicted before the enactment of Code § 8.01-654(A)(2).       We have stated the following principles that are  pertinent here:            "The generally accepted rule is that statutes      of limitation, or remedial statutes, are not      retrospective in their application in the absence of      clear legislative intent. However, it is the      settled law of this State that the legislature may      declare a new or an amended statute dealing solely      with matters of remedy and procedure, or one not      affecting vested interests and contractual rights,      to have a retrospective operation. Ferguson v.      Ferguson, 169 Va. 77, 87, 192 S.E. 774, 777      [(1937)]; Gloucester Realty Corp. v. Guthrie, 182      Va. 869, 873, 30 S.E.2d 686, 688 [(1944)] . . . .      Vested interests and contractual rights may not be      impaired or destroyed, but mere matters of procedure      and remedy for their enforcement or preservation may      be altered, curtailed or repealed at the will of the      legislature so long as reasonable opportunity and      time are afforded to enforce and protect such      interests and rights."  Phipps, Adm'r v. Sutherland, 201 Va. 448, 452, 111 S.E.2d 422,  425 (1959); accord Board of Supervisors v. FCS Building  Association, 254 Va. 464, 467, 492 S.E.2d 634, 636 (1997);  Harris v. DiMattina, 250 Va. 306, 311-12, 462 S.E.2d 338, 340  (1995); Shiflet v. Eller, 228 Va. 115, 119, 319 S.E.2d 750,  753 (1984); Fletcher v. Tarasidis, 219 Va. 658, 661, 250                                  3 S.E.2d 739, 740 (1979); Walke v. Dallas, 209 Va. 32, 36, 161  S.E.2d 722, 724 (1968).   We also held in Duffy v. Hartsock,  187 Va. 406, 416, 46 S.E.2d 570, 574 (1948), that matters of  procedure, such as statutes of limitations, may be altered or  curtailed by the legislature if a reasonable opportunity and  time are afforded to enforce and protect any interests and  rights, provided vested interests and contractual rights are  neither impaired nor destroyed.       As the Warden correctly observes, this Court has  routinely considered petitions for writs of habeas corpus  filed within the statutorily prescribed one-year period.    We  have also dismissed petitions as untimely that were filed by  prisoners who were convicted before the enactment of Code  § 8.01-654(A)(2), but who filed their petitions more than one  year after the effective date of that statute.   Implicit in  our prior practice is this Court's recognition that a period  of one year constitutes a reasonable time in which to permit a  prisoner who was convicted prior to the enactment of Code  § 8.01-654(A)(2) to enforce and protect his rights.  Therefore, we hold that the statute of limitations contained  in Code § 8.01-654(A)(2) bars Haas' petition because he was  provided a reasonable opportunity to enforce and protect his  right to file his habeas corpus petition.                                       4      We observe that our holding is consistent with the views  expressed by the United States Courts of Appeals.    Prior to  the enactment of the statute of limitations contained in the  Federal Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996,  which amended 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1), there was no federal  statute of limitations that prescribed the time available for  a prisoner to file a federal habeas corpus petition.     See  Brown v. Angelone, 150 F.3d 370, 371 (4th Cir. 1998); Calderon  v. United States District Court, 128 F.3d 1283, 1286 & n.1  (9th Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1099, and cert. denied  sub nom. Beeler v. Calderon, 523 U.S. 1061 (1998).     However,  Rule 9(a) of the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases in the  United States District Courts permitted a district court to  dismiss a petition "if it appears that the state . . . has  been prejudiced in its ability to respond to the petition by  delay in its filing unless the petitioner shows that it is  based on grounds of which he could not have had knowledge by  the exercise of reasonable diligence before the circumstances  prejudicial to the state occurred."   The various United States  Courts of Appeals have held that a prisoner whose statutory  right to seek federal habeas corpus relief accrued before the  enactment of the one-year statute of limitations must receive  a reasonable period of time after the statute's effective date  to file a federal habeas corpus petition and that one year was                                  5 reasonable.   See Brown, 150 F.3d at 374-76; United States v.  Flores, 135 F.3d 1000, 1005-06 (5th Cir. 1998); Burns v.  Morton, 134 F.3d 109, 111 (3rd Cir. 1998); Calderon, 128 F.3d  at 1286-87; United States v. Simmonds, 111 F.3d 737, 746 (10th  Cir. 1997).       We find no merit in Haas' contention that because Code  § 8.01-654(A)(2) creates a two-year statute of limitations for  the filing of a habeas corpus petition, a period of two years  rather than one year must be deemed reasonable.   The issue  that we must consider is what is a reasonable period of time  that should be accorded a habeas corpus petitioner whose right  to file a habeas corpus petition would have been barred  otherwise by the enactment of Code § 8.01-654(A)(2).   In  deciding this issue, we are not bound by the time prescribed  in the statute of limitations.       Additionally, Haas argues that this Court should conclude  that a period of two years is reasonable because a habeas  corpus petitioner needs sufficient time to develop a factual  basis to support his claims.   We find no merit in this  contention because petitioners, like Haas, had time before the  enactment of Code § 8.01-654(A)(2) in which to file their  claims, and they were accorded the additional benefit of the  one-year reasonable period of time after the effective date of                                      6 the statute.   In this instance, Haas had almost five years in  which to prepare and file his petition for habeas corpus.       Haas contends that the Suspension Clause contained in  Article I, § 9 of the Constitution of Virginia requires an  exception to the statute of limitations when a petitioner  could not have discovered the factual basis of his petition  before the expiration of the statute of limitations.   We  cannot consider Haas' constitutional claim because, as he  admits in his brief, he failed to assert this claim in the  circuit court.       In view of our holdings, we need not consider Haas'  remaining contentions.   Accordingly, the judgment of the  circuit court will be affirmed.

This statute, which became effective July 1, 1998, states:</p> <blockquote>"A petition for writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum, other than a petition challenging a criminal conviction or sentence, shall be brought within one year after the cause of action accrues. A habeas corpus petition attacking a criminal conviction or sentence, except as provided in § 8.01-654.1 for cases in which a death sentence has been imposed, shall be filed within two years from the date of final judgment in the trial court or within one year from either final disposition of the direct appeal in state court or the time for filing such appeal has expired, whichever is later."</blockquote> <p>Michael Haas is incarcerated by the Virginia Department of Corrections and detained at the Keen Mountain Correctional Center. He was convicted in 1994 of two counts of sodomy against his two sons. His punishment was fixed at two terms of life imprisonment.</p> <p>On June 30, 2000, Haas filed his petition for writ of habeas corpus against Jack Lee, Warden of the Keen Mountain Correctional Center. He alleged, among other things, that his due process rights were violated, that his trial counsel was ineffective, and that the Commonwealth's Attorney purportedly committed acts of misconduct.</p> <p>The Warden filed a motion to dismiss and asserted that because Haas was convicted before the enactment of Code § 8.01-654(A)(2) and more than two years had passed from the date of the final judgment in the circuit court, he was required to file his habeas corpus petition, pursuant to orders entered by this Court, within one year from the effective date of Code § 8.01-654(A)(2). The Warden contended that Haas' petition must be dismissed because he was required to file it on or before June 30, 1999, but he did not do so. The circuit court agreed with the Warden and entered a final order dismissing the petition. Haas appeals.</p> <p>Before the enactment of Code § 8.01-654(A)(2), a prisoner could file a habeas corpus petition at any time provided that the Commonwealth was not prejudiced in its ability to respond because of the prisoner's delay in filing. <i>See </i><i>Walker v. Mitchell, Warden,</i> 224 Va. 568, 575-77, 299 S.E.2d 698, 702-03 (1983). After the enactment of this statute, a prisoner who had not been sentenced to death was required to file his petition within two years from the date of final judgment in the circuit court or one year from either final disposition of the direct appeal in the state court or the time for filing such appeal has expired, whichever is later. The statute is silent, however, regarding the filing period for prisoners who were convicted before the enactment of Code § 8.01-654(A)(2).</p> <p>We have stated the following principles that are pertinent here:</p> <blockquote>"The generally accepted rule is that statutes of limitation, or remedial statutes, are not retrospective in their application in the absence of clear legislative intent. However, it is the settled law of this State that the legislature may declare a new or an amended statute dealing solely with matters of remedy and procedure, or one not affecting vested interests and contractual rights, to have a retrospective operation. <i>Ferguson v. Ferguson,</i> 169 Va. 77, 87, 192 S.E. 774, 777 [(1937)]; <i>Gloucester Realty Corp. v. Guthrie,</i> 182 Va. 869, 873, 30 S.E.2d 686, 688 [(1944)]. . . Vested interests and contractual rights may not be impaired or destroyed, but mere matters of procedure and remedy for their enforcement or preservation may be altered, curtailed or repealed at the will of the legislature so long as reasonable opportunity and time are afforded to enforce and protect such interests and rights."</blockquote> <p><i>Phipps, Adm'r v. Sutherland,</i> 201 Va. 448, 452, 111 S.E.2d 422, 425 (1959); <i>accord </i><i>Board of Supervisors v. FCS Building Association,</i> 254 Va. 464, 467, 492 S.E.2d 634, 636 (1997); <i>Harris v.

Hartsock,</i> 187 Va. 406, 416, 46 S.E.2d 570, 574 (1948), that matters of procedure, such as statutes of limitations, may be altered or curtailed by the legislature if a reasonable opportunity <span class="star-pagination">*258</span> and time are afforded to enforce and protect any interests and rights, provided vested interests and contractual rights are neither impaired nor destroyed.</p> <p>As the Warden correctly observes, this Court has routinely considered petitions for writs of habeas corpus filed within the statutorily prescribed one-year period, We have also dismissed petitions as untimely that were filed by prisoners who were convicted before the enactment of Code § 8.01-654(A)(2), but who filed their petitions more than one year after the effective date of that statute. Implicit in our prior practice is this Court's recognition that a period of one year constitutes a reasonable time in which to permit a prisoner who was convicted prior to the enactment of Code § 8.01-654(A)(2) to enforce and protect his rights. Therefore, we hold that the statute of limitations contained in Code § 8.01-654(A)(2) bars Haas' petition because he was provided a reasonable opportunity to enforce and protect his right to file his habeas corpus petition.</p> <p>We observe that our holding is consistent with the views expressed by the United States Courts of Appeals. Prior to the enactment of the statute of limitations contained in the Federal Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, which amended 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1), there was no federal statute of limitations that prescribed the time available for a prisoner to file a federal habeas corpus petition. <i>See </i><i>Brown v. Angelone,</i> 150 F.3d 370, 371 (4th Cir.1998); <i>Calderon v. United States District Court,</i> 128 F.3d 1283, 1286 &amp; n. 1 (9th Cir. 1997), <i>cert. denied,</i> 622 U.S. 1099, 118 S.Ct. 899, 139 L.Ed.2d 884, and <i>cert. denied sub nom. Beeler v. Calderon,</i> 523 U.S. 1061, 118 S.Ct. 1389, 140 L.Ed.2d 648 (1998). However, Rule 9(a) of the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases in the United States District Courts permitted a district court to dismiss a petition "if it appears that the state ... has been prejudiced in its ability to respond to the petition by delay in its filing unless the petitioner shows that it is based on grounds of which he could not have had knowledge by the exercise of reasonable diligence before the circumstances prejudicial to the state occurred." The various United States Courts of Appeals have held that a prisoner whose statutory right to seek federal habeas corpus relief accrued before the enactment of the one-year statute of limitations must receive a reasonable period of time after the statute's effective date to file a federal habeas corpus petition and that one year was reasonable. <i>See </i><i>Brown,</i> 150 F.3d at 374-76; <i>United States v. Flores,</i> 135 F.3d 1000, 1005-06 (5th Cir.1998); <i>Burns v. Morton,</i> 134 F.3d 109, 111 (3rd Cir.1998); <i>Calderon,</i> 128 F.3d at 1286-87; <i>United States v. Simmonds,</i> 111 F.3d 737, 746 (10th Cir.1997).</p> <p>We find no merit in Haas' contention that because Code § 8.01-654(A)(2) creates a twoyear statute of limitations for the filing of a habeas corpus petition, a period of two years rather than one year must be deemed reasonable. The issue that we must consider is what is a reasonable period of time that should be accorded a habeas corpus petitioner whose right to file a habeas corpus petition would have been barred otherwise by the enactment of Code § 8.01-654(A)(2). In deciding this issue, we are not bound by the time prescribed in the statute of limitations.</p> <p>Additionally, Haas argues that this Court should conclude that a period of two years is reasonable because a habeas corpus petitioner needs sufficient time to develop a factual basis to support his claims.

Implicit in our prior practice is this Court's recognition that a period of one year constitutes a reasonable time in which to permit a prisoner who was convicted prior to the enactment of Code § 8.01-654(A)(2) to enforce and protect his rights. Therefore, we hold that the statute of limitations contained in Code § 8.01-654(A)(2) bars Haas' petition because he was provided a reasonable opportunity to enforce and protect his right to file his habeas corpus petition.</p> <p>We observe that our holding is consistent with the views expressed by the United States Courts of Appeals. Prior to the enactment of the statute of limitations contained in the Federal Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, which amended 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1), there was no federal statute of limitations that prescribed the time available for a prisoner to file a federal habeas corpus petition. <i>See </i><i>Brown v.

However, Rule 9(a) of the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases in the United States District Courts permitted a district court to dismiss a petition "if it appears that the state ... has been prejudiced in its ability to respond to the petition by delay in its filing unless the petitioner shows that it is based on grounds of which he could not have had knowledge by the exercise of reasonable diligence before the circumstances prejudicial to the state occurred." The various United States Courts of Appeals have held that a prisoner whose statutory right to seek federal habeas corpus relief accrued before the enactment of the one-year statute of limitations must receive a reasonable period of time after the statute's effective date to file a federal habeas corpus petition and that one year was reasonable. <i>See </i><i>Brown,</i> 150 F.3d at 374-76; <i>United States v.

The issue that we must consider is what is a reasonable period of time that should be accorded a habeas corpus petitioner whose right to file a habeas corpus petition would have been barred otherwise by the enactment of Code § 8.01-654(A)(2). In deciding this issue, we are not bound by the time prescribed in the statute of limitations.</p> <p>Additionally, Haas argues that this Court should conclude that a period of two years is reasonable because a habeas corpus petitioner needs sufficient time to develop a factual basis to support his claims. We find no merit in this contention because petitioners, like Haas, had time before the enactment of Code § 8.01-654(A)(2) in which to file their claims, and they were accorded the additional benefit of the one-year reasonable period of time after the effective date of the statute. In this instance, Haas had almost five years in which to prepare and file his petition for habeas corpus.</p> <p>Haas contends that the Suspension Clause contained in Article I, § 9 of the Constitution of Virginia requires an exception to the statute of limitations when a petitioner could not have discovered the factual basis of his petition before the expiration of the statute of limitations. We cannot consider Haas' constitutional claim because, as he admits in his brief, he failed to assert this claim in the circuit court.</p> <p>In view of our holdings, we need not consider Haas' remaining contentions.

Lee	https://www.vacourts.gov/static/opinions/opnscvwp/1010310.pdf	The circuit court properly dismissed a petition for writ of habeas corpus because it was not filed timely pursuant to Code § 8.01- 654(A)(2), which became effective July 1, 1998. The statute of limitations contained in that section bars the petition because petitioner was provided a reasonable opportunity to enforce and protect his right to file his habeas corpus petition.																							2002	https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1059365/haas-v-lee/
